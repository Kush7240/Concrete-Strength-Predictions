# Concrete-Strength-Predictions

# 1. Importance
    Concrete strength is a critical factor in construction, determining the durability, safety, and performance of structures. Traditionally, strength is measured through compressive strength tests, which are time-consuming and expensive. Predicting strength in advance 
    can help in Optimize material mix proportions, Reduce testing time and cost, Improve construction efficiency, Minimize errors in structural design

# 2. Machine Learning in Concrete Strength Prediction
    ML models can be trained on historical data to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its mix composition and curing time. Instead of relying solely on empirical formulas, ML models learn from data patterns and provide highly accurate predictions.
    Key Features for Prediction: Cement, Water content, Fine aggregate and coarse aggregate, Fly ash and blast furnace slag, superplasticizers, water-cement ratio, age of concrete

# 3. ML techniques used
    Linear Regression, gradient boosting
